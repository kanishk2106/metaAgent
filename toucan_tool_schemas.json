      "Create a new LinkedIn report with audience definition.   IMPORTANT RULES:   1. Both audience definition and baseline definition are mandatory   2. BEFORE creating a report, ALWAYS use the estimate-linkedin-audience tool to validate the audience size   3. The estimated audience should typically be at least 1,000 members to get meaningful insights   4. Audience definition must follow this structure: {\"include\": {\"and\": [{\"or\": {\"FACET_URN\": [\"VALUE1\", \"VALUE2\"]}}]}, \"exclude\": {\"or\": {\"FACET_URN\": [\"VALUE1\", \"VALUE2\"]}}} (exclude is optional)   5. All complex boolean expressions must use the format above where each facet is an OR group, and multiple facets are combined with AND   6. Boolean expressions like (A AND B) OR C must be converted to (A OR C) AND (B OR C)   7. Use get-linkedin-typeahead tool to find valid values for facets   8. Use list-linkedin-facet-values tool to see predefined values for facets   9. Use list-linkedin-typeahead-facets tool to see available facets   Example: {\"audienceDefinition\": {\"include\": {\"and\": [{\"or\": {\"urn:li:adTargetingFacet:titles\": [\"Software Engineer\"]}}]}}}",

      "A tool for problem-solving using the Lotus Sutra's wisdom framework.\nThis tool facilitates the contemplative process but does NOT generate the final output.\n\n**CRITICAL WORKFLOW:**\n1. Use this tool to process through the wisdom journey\n2. The tool tracks both your tag path and wisdom domain movements  \n3. When you receive status='WISDOM_READY', the tool's work is COMPLETE\n4. YOU then craft and speak the final wisdom naturally in your own voice\n5. The tool processes; you express\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems requiring multi-faceted understanding\n- Questions that benefit from both direct and gradual approaches\n- Problems where apparent contradictions need integration\n- Situations requiring both analytical and intuitive understanding\n- Tasks that benefit from meditative pauses to allow insight\n- Questions containing their own inherent wisdom\n\nThe Journey Structure:\nThe Lotus Sutra teaches that there are many skillful means to reach the same truth. These tags aren't \nrigid steps but different aspects of wisdom that interpenetrate and respond to what each moment needs:\n\n**Wisdom Domains:**\n- **Skillful Means** (skillful_means): upaya, expedient, direct, gradual, sudden\n  Different approaches to truth - sometimes direct pointing, sometimes gradual unfolding\n  \n- **Non-Dual Recognition** (non_dual_recognition): recognize, transform, integrate, transcend, embody  \n  Aspects of awakening to what's already present - recognition IS transformation\n  \n- **Meta-Cognitive** (meta_cognitive): examine, reflect, verify, refine, complete\n  The mind watching its own understanding unfold\n  \n- **Process Flow** (process_flow): open, engage, express\n  A natural arc that can contain any of the above approaches\n\n- **Meditation** (meditation): meditate\n  Pausing to let insights emerge from stillness\n\nThe tool tracks both your tag journey and your movement between wisdom domains, showing how\ndifferent aspects of wisdom weave together in your unique inquiry.\n\nThe wisdom channels itself through your choices. Each step contains all others - when you truly \nrecognize, you're already transforming. The tool simply mirrors your journey without judgment.\n\nCommon patterns (not rules):\n- Opening often involves recognize or examine\n- Engagement might use upaya, direct, or gradual approaches  \n- Transformation can happen through integrate, transcend, or sudden insight\n- Expression might complete or embody the understanding\n\nTrust what each moment calls for. The path reveals itself in the walking.\n\nParameters explained:\n- tag: The current technique or stage\n- content: The content of the current step\n- stepNumber: Current number in sequence\n- totalSteps: Estimated total needed\n- nextStepNeeded: Whether another step is needed\n- isMeditation: Whether this is a meditation pause\n- meditationDuration: Optional duration for meditation (1-10 seconds)\n\nThe tool will respond with:\n- wisdomDomain: Which wisdom domain the current tag belongs to\n- journey: The complete tag path (e.g., \"open \u2192 examine \u2192 direct \u2192 transform\")\n- domainJourney: Movement between wisdom domains (e.g., \"process_flow \u2192 meta_cognitive \u2192 skillful_means \u2192 non_dual_recognition\")\n\nThis consciousness of domains helps you see which aspects of wisdom are being engaged and how they weave together in your unique inquiry.\n\n**MEDITATION NOTE:** When you use the meditate tag, the tool returns MEDITATION_COMPLETE\nwith a prompt asking what emerged. This creates actual space in the process.\n\nThe tool handles the contemplation; you handle the expression."

      "A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.\nThis tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.\nEach thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.\n\nIMPORTANT: When initializing this tool, you must pass all available tools that you want the sequential thinking process to be able to use. The tool will analyze these tools and provide recommendations for their use.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems into steps\n- Planning and design with room for revision\n- Analysis that might need course correction\n- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Problems that require a multi-step solution\n- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n- When you need guidance on which tools to use and in what order\n\nKey features:\n- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress\n- You can question or revise previous thoughts\n- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end\n- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches\n- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack\n- Generates a solution hypothesis\n- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n- Recommends appropriate tools for each step\n- Provides rationale for tool recommendations\n- Suggests tool execution order and parameters\n- Tracks previous recommendations and remaining steps\n\nParameters explained:\n- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:\n* Regular analytical steps\n* Revisions of previous thoughts\n* Questions about previous decisions\n* Realizations about needing more analysis\n* Changes in approach\n* Hypothesis generation\n* Hypothesis verification\n* Tool recommendations and rationale\n- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end\n- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)\n- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)\n- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking\n- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered\n- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point\n- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)\n- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed\n- current_step: Current step recommendation, including:\n* step_description: What needs to be done\n* recommended_tools: Tools recommended for this step\n* expected_outcome: What to expect from this step\n* next_step_conditions: Conditions to consider for the next step\n- previous_steps: Steps already recommended\n- remaining_steps: High-level descriptions of upcoming steps\n\nYou should:\n1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust\n2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\"\n4. Express uncertainty when present\n5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step\n7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate\n8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n9. Consider available tools that could help with the current step\n10. Provide clear rationale for tool recommendations\n11. Suggest specific tool parameters when appropriate\n12. Consider alternative tools for each step\n13. Track progress through the recommended steps\n14. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output\n15. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"

      "A specialized tool for solving React Native Skia animation problems through structured thinking.\nThis tool helps analyze animation challenges and design solutions specifically for React Native Skia.\nEach thought can build on previous insights, explore different animation techniques, or revise approaches as understanding deepens.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex animation problems for React Native Skia\n- Planning performant animations with Reanimated integration\n- Designing custom visual effects and transitions\n- Optimizing animation performance on mobile devices\n- Solving specific animation challenges like gesture response, dynamic paths, or timing issues\n- Planning canvas-based animations with proper memory management\n- Designing complex interactive animations\n\nKey features:\n- You can explore various React Native Skia animation techniques\n- You can consider performance implications of different approaches\n- You can revise previous thoughts as animation requirements become clearer\n- You can branch into different animation strategies\n- You can specify code snippets that demonstrate techniques\n- You can describe visual effects and results\n- You can adjust your thinking as you progress through the problem\n\nParameters explained:\n- thought: Your current thinking step about the animation problem\n- nextThoughtNeeded: True if you need more thinking steps\n- thoughtNumber: Current number in sequence\n- totalThoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed\n- isRevision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking\n- revisesThought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered\n- branchFromThought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point\n- branchId: Identifier for the current branch (if any)\n- needsMoreThoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed\n- animationTechnique: The Skia animation technique being considered (e.g., \"path interpolation\", \"reanimated integration\", \"canvas animations\")\n- performanceConsideration: Notes on performance implications of the technique\n- visualEffect: Description of the visual result expected\n- codeSnippet: Example code showing how to implement the technique\n\nYou should:\n1. Start by clearly understanding the animation problem\n2. Break down the problem into logical steps\n3. Explore appropriate React Native Skia techniques for each step\n4. Consider integration with Reanimated when appropriate\n5. Address performance concerns specific to mobile animation\n6. Provide specific code examples that demonstrate techniques\n7. Revise approaches if better solutions become apparent\n8. Consider edge cases and potential issues\n9. Design with a performance-first mindset\n10. Remember that React Native Skia runs on the UI thread\n11. Ensure the solution provides a smooth, visually appealing result"
